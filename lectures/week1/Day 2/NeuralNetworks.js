    1. The first step that must be taken is to let the goat go across the river, 
       as any other actions will result in the goat or the cabbage being eaten.
    2. When the farmer returns to the original side, he has the choice of taking 
       either the wolf or the cabbage across next.
    3. If he takes the wolf across, he would have to return to get the cabbage, 
       resulting in the wolf eating the goat.
    4. If he takes the cabbage across second, he will need to return to get the wolf, 
       resulting in the cabbage being eaten by the goat.
    5. The dilemma is solved by taking the wolf (or the cabbage) over and bringing 
       the goat back. 
    6. Now he can take the cabbage (or the wolf) over, and finally return to fetch 
       the goat.
