    <h1>Pizza</h1>
    <p>
      Pizza (Italian: [ˈpittsa], Neapolitan: [ˈpittsə]) is a dish of Italian
      origin consisting of a usually round, flat base of leavened wheat-based
      dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients
      (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.),
      which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
      oven. [1] A small pizza is sometimes called a pizzetta. A person who makes
      pizza is known as a pizzaiolo.

    <h3>Etymology</h3>
    <p>
      The word "pizza" first appeared in a Latin text from the town of Gaeta,
      then still part of the Byzantine Empire, in 997 AD; the text states that a
      tenant of certain property is to give the bishop of Gaeta duodecim pizze
      ("twelve pizzas") every Christmas Day, and another twelve every Easter
      Sunday.[4][16]

    <h3>History</h3>
    <p>
      Foods similar to pizza have been made since the Neolithic Age.[23] Records
      of people adding other ingredients to bread to make it more flavorful can
      be found throughout ancient history. In the 6th century BC, the Persian
      soldiers of the Achaemenid Empire during the rule of Darius the Great
      baked flatbreads with cheese and dates on top of their battle
      shields[24][25] and the ancient Greeks supplemented their bread with oils,
      herbs, and cheese.[26][27] An early reference to a pizza-like food occurs
      in the Aeneid, when Celaeno, queen of the Harpies, foretells that the
      Trojans would not find peace until they are forced by hunger to eat their
      tables (Book III). In Book VII, Aeneas and his men are served a meal that
      includes round cakes (like pita bread) topped with cooked vegetables. When
      they eat the bread, they realize that these are the "tables" prophesied by
      Celaeno.[28] The first mention of the word "pizza" comes from a notarial
      document written in Latin and dating to May 997 AD from Gaeta, demanding a
      payment of "twelve pizzas, a pork shoulder, and a pork kidney on Christmas
      Day, and 12 pizzas and a couple of chickens on Easter Day."[29]
